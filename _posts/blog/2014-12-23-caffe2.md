Although CAFFE has a good [compliation insturction][comp] on Berkeley's BLVC project website, you may still encounter some issues during compilation. This post records some issues I have encountered, which might the same issue for you. 
##Step 1: Clone down CAFFE on GitHub
First, cd to the directory you want CAFFE to be installed
Then, clone down CAFFE to your local machine. 

    ##git clone
    git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
The Makefile.config (in $CAFFE root directory) contains some configuration variables which is used in Makefile. 

##Step2: Compile with cuDNN accerleration

cuDNN package gives you 1.3x speed boost according to [Nvidia test][NV]. 
If you want to compile with cuDNN accleration, which will give
